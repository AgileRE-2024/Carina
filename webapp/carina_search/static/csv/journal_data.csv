"Skin cancer can quickly become fatal. An examination and biopsy of dermoscopic pictures are required to determine if skin cancer is malignant or benign. However, these examinations can be costly.","In this research, we proposed deep learning (DL)-based approach to identify a melanoma, the most dangerous kind of skin cancer. DL is particularly excellent in learning traits and predicting cancer. However, DL requires a vast number of images.Method: We used image augmentation and transferring learning to categorise images into benign and malignant. We used the public ISIC 2020 database to train and test our models. The ISIC 2020 dataset classifies melanoma as malignant. Along with the categorization, the dataset was examined for variation. The training and validation accuracy of three of the best pre-trained models were compared.

Ocean surface currents need to be monitored to minimize accidents at ship crossings. One way to predict ocean currents”and estimate the danger level of the sea”is by finding out the currents' velocity and their future direction.,This study aims to predict the velocity and direction of ocean surface currents.,"This research uses the Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN). This study used 3,750 long-term data and 72 short-term data.","The evaluation with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) achieved the best results in short-term predictions. The best MAPE of the U currents (east to west) was 14.0279% with five inputs; the first and second hidden layers were 50 and 100, and the learning rate was 0.3. While the best MAPE of the V currents (north to south) was 3.1253% with five inputs, the first and second hidden layers were 20 and 50, and the learning rate was 0.1. The ocean surface currents' prediction indicates that the current state is from east to south with a magnitude of around 169,5773°-175,7127° resulting in a MAPE of 0.0668%.","ERNN is more effective than single exponential smoothing and RBFNN in ocean current prediction studies because it produces a smaller error value.

"Twitter is one of the most used social media, with 310 million active users monthly and 500 million tweets per day. Twitter is not only used to talk about trending topics but also to share information about accidents, fires, traffic jams, etc. People often find these updates useful to minimize the impact.","The current study compares the effectiveness of three deep learning methods (CNN, RCNN, CLSTM) combined with neuroNER in classifying multi-label incidents.","NeuroNER is paired with different deep learning classification methods (CNN, RCNN, CLSTM).",CNN paired with NeuroNER yield the best results for multi-label classification compared to CLSTM and RCNN.,"CNN was proven to be more effective with an average precision value of 88.54% for multi-label incidents classification. This is because the data we used for the classification resulted from NER, which was in the form of entity labels. CNN immediately distinguishes important information, namely the NER labels. CLSTM generates the worst result because it is more suitable for sequential data.

Question-answer (QA) is a popular method to seek health-related information and biomedical data. Such questions can refer to more than one medical entity (multi-label) so determining the correct tags is not easy. The question classification (QC) mechanism in a QA system can narrow down the answers we are seeking.,This study develops a multi-label classification using the heterogeneous ensembles method to improve accuracy in biomedical data with long text dimensions.,"We used the ensemble method with heterogeneous deep learning and machine learning for multi-label extended text classification. There are 15 various single models consisting of three deep learning (CNN, LSTM, and BERT) and four machine learning algorithms (SVM, kNN, Decision Tree, and Naí¯ve Bayes) with various text representations (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and FastText). We used the bagging approach with a hard voting mechanism for the decision-making.","The result shows that deep learning is more powerful than machine learning as a single multi-label biomedical data classification method. Moreover, we found that top-three was the best number of base learners by combining the ensembles method. Heterogeneous-based ensembles with three learners resulted in an F1-score of 82.3%, which is better than the best single model by CNN with an F1-score of 80%.",A multi-label classification of biomedical QA using ensemble models is better than single models.

"In the last decade, the number of registered vehicles has grown exponentially. With more vehicles on the road, traffic jams, accidents, and violations also increase. A license plate plays a key role in solving such problems because it stores a vehicle's historical information. Therefore, automated license-plate character recognition is needed.",This study proposes a recognition system that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to recognize characters from a license plate's images. We called it a modified LeNet-5 architecture.,"We used four different CNN architectures to recognize license plate characters: AlexNet, LeNet-5, modified LeNet-5, and ResNet-50 architectures. We evaluated the performance based on their accuracy and computation time. We compared the deep learning methods with the Freeman chain code (FCC) extraction with support vector machine (SVM). We also evaluated the Otsu and the threshold binarization performances when applied in the FCC extraction method.","The ResNet-50 and modified LeNet-5 produces the best accuracy during the training at 0.97. The precision and recall scores of the ResNet-50 are both 0.97, while the modified LeNet-5's values are 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. The modified LeNet-5 shows a slightly higher precision score but a lower recall score. The modified LeNet-5 shows a slightly lower accuracy during the testing than ResNet-50. Meanwhile, the Otsu binarization's FCC extraction is better than the threshold binarization. Overall, the FCC extraction technique performs less effectively than CNN. The modified LeNet-5 computes the fastest at 7 mins and 57 secs, while ResNet-50 needs 42 mins and 11 secs.","We discovered that CNN is better than the FCC extraction method with SVM. Both ResNet-50 and the modified LeNet-5 perform best during the training, with F measure scoring 0.97. However, ResNet-50 outperforms the modified LeNet-5 during the testing, with F-measure at 0.97 and 1.00, respectively. In addition, the FCC extraction using the Otsu binarization is better than the threshold binarization. Otsu binarization reached 0.91, higher than the static threshold binarization at 127. In addition, Otsu binarization produces a dynamic threshold value depending on the images' light intensity.","Convolutional Neural Network, Freeman Chain Code, License Plate Character Recognition, Support Vector Machine","Firman Maulana Adhari, Taufik Fuadi Abidin, Ridha Ferdhiana","April 26, 2022",https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/JISEBI/article/view/32497/17561,License Plate Character Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network

Inventory policy highly influences Supply Chain Management (SCM) process. Evidence suggests that almost half of SCM costs are set off by stock-related expenses.,This paper aims to minimise total inventory cost in SCM by applying a multi-agent-based machine learning called Reinforcement Learning (RL).,"The ability of RL in finding a hidden pattern of inventory policy is run under various constraints which have not been addressed together or simultaneously in previous research. These include capacitated manufacturer and warehouse, limitation of order to suppliers, stochastic demand, lead time uncertainty and multi-sourcing supply. RL was run through Q-Learning with four experiments and 1,000 iterations to examine its result consistency. Then, RL was contrasted to the previous mathematical method to check its efficiency in reducing inventory costs.","After 1,000 trial-error simulations, the most striking finding is that RL can perform more efficiently than the mathematical approach by placing optimum order quantities at the right time. In addition, this result was achieved under complex constraints and assumptions which have not been simultaneously simulated in previous studies.","Results confirm that the RL approach will be invaluable when implemented to comparable supply network environments expressed in this project.

"Stock investment has been gaining momentum in the past years due to the development of technology. During the pandemic lockdown, people have invested more. One the one hand, stock investment has high potential profitability, but on the other, it is equally risky. Therefore, a value at risk (VaR) analysis is needed. One approach to calculate VaR is by using the Bayesian mixture model, which has been proven to be able to overcome heavy-tailed cases. Then, the VaR's accuracy needs to be tested, and one of the ways is by using backtesting, such as the Kupiec test.","This study aims to determine the VaR model of PT NFC Indonesia Tbk (NFCX) return data using Bayesian mixture modelling and backtesting.
